# Sikraken: A Test Suites Generator for C Code ![A Kraken](/Documentation/kraken_attackin__by_captainnutmeg_ddp8r4y-pre-small.jpg)

**Sikraken** is a new test data generator project for C code started in June 2024 by Dr Christophe Meudec, echancrure@gmail.com. It aims to achieve maximal 'branch' coverage. 

It is a side project developed in an agile way by a team of one, part time; so don't expect miracles.

It reuses bits and pieces from other projects:
  - a parser for C using Flex/Bison;
  - a symbolic executor written in Prolog (ECLiPSe flavour);
  - a solver [PTC-Solver](https://github.com/echancrure/PTC-Solver) which uses Constraint Logic Programming (ECLiPSe flavour).

The initial goal is to move towards tackling [Test-Comp benchmarks](https://test-comp.sosy-lab.org/) in an agile way.

Another commitment is to keep the [Sikraken Development Guide Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uDLnlrFGWUNYyzsotZAZ_jFVrRSPEoixVMgw1UZZ0ug/edit?usp=sharing) useful, uptodate and tidy.
